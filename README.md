Flib
==== ====

Some c++ classes i created to be able to use OpenGL easier and some math classes

==== ====

I made some makefiles to compile the code.
They are located in /src

You can compile it for windows by calling make -f makefile.win in /src
this creates the static libs in /libWin

Also i'm new to github (heard it is really good) and just experimenting
